{"name":"Hydra","tagline":"A JVM based DispatcherComposer Engine","body":"# Hydra\r\nHydra is a JVM based DispatcherComposer Engine.\r\n\r\nBasically, you define the tasks to be performed and the input required for each of those tasks.\r\nFrom then on Hydra takes over - It creates the dependency graph, performs tasks in required\r\norder and composes the final output.\r\n\r\nFor each task to be performed, the input can be composed on any of the initial input parameters\r\nor output from already completed tasks. Same is the case with final response.\r\n\r\n## Quick Usage\r\n\r\nAdd following to `<repositories/>` section of pom.xml -\r\n```xml\r\n<repository>\r\n  <id>clojars</id>\r\n  <name>Clojars repository</name>\r\n  <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>\r\n</repository>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd following to `<dependencies/>` section of your pom.xml -\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.flipkart.hydra</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>dispatcher</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now, call `Dispatcher` using following code\r\n```java\r\n// Already resolved list of parameters\r\nMap<String, Object> initialParams = ...;\r\n\r\n// Map of tasks to be dispatched (mapped to the keys that will store the task response)\r\nMap<String, Task> tasks = ...;\r\n\r\n// Final response that needs to be realized\r\nMap<String, Object> response = ...;\r\n\r\n// Dispatcher Call\r\nDispatcher dispatcher = new DefaultDispatcher();\r\nObject output = defaultDispatcher.execute(initialParams, tasks, response);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Salient Points\r\n+ Easy to use interfaces\r\n+ Auto creation/resolution of dependencies graph\r\n+ Notation to express variables/expressions\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThe change log can be found [here](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/hydra/blob/master/CHANGES.md)\r\n\r\n## Contribution, Bugs and Feedback\r\n\r\nFor bugs, questions and discussions please use the [Github Issues](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/hydra/issues).\r\nPlease follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/hydra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting pull requests.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Flipkart Internet, pvt ltd.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
